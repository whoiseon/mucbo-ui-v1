# Mucbo UI

Mucbo UI is a design system built with react(with next.js). It provides ready-to-use components that are easily available in web applications.

This project aims to achieve these three major objectives:

- Should provide most of the common components for building a web service.
- Should be able to support dark theme without any hassle.
- Should be easily customizable.

> This project was created for individual use. But everyone can use it, and if you need anything, please request it.
